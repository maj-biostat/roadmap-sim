# ROADMAP Simulations

This is attempt to incorporate the simulation and reporting of trial operating characteristics into a single project.
I know, this might be (a) tricky and (b) foolish.
However, I thought it would be worth a go.

## Simulations

| Script  | Description  |
|--------|--------|
| `sim-single-analysis.R`        | Simulation of simple parallel group trial.  Single analysis. Main goal is to get the simulation framework and reporting configured. |

## Make

Key targets are described:

| Target  | Description  |
|--------|--------|
| `make data`  | Removes any existing db and re-simulate new trial data. Sim cfg is presently pre-canned. |

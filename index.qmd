This site contains notes, data summaries and simulation results for the ROADMAP study.

All the code can be found on github, just use the icon to the top right.
The functionality herein has a dependency on the `roadmap.data` R package, which can also be found via the above link (see the readme for this repo).
If you find any issues, let me know and I will prioritise accordingly.

## Notes/TODO

+ Analyses based on cohorts having reached primary endpoint (12 months post rand)
+ Query definition and implementation of targets of inference (`b_r`, `b_r1d` etc)
+ Should inference and decisions leading to trial actions be restricted to very specific questions ?
+ TODO - compute implications of NI margin in terms of risk for each parameter
+ TODO - compute family wise type-i errors?

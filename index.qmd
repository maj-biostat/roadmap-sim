This site contains notes, data summaries and simulation results for the ROADMAP study.

All the code can be found on github, just use the icon to the top right.
The functionality herein has a dependency on the `roadmap.data` R package, which can also be found via the above link (see the readme for this repo).
If you find any issues, let me know and I will prioritise accordingly.

The primary outcome is treatment success at 12 months post platform entry, defined as **all of**: 

1. Alive
2. Clinical cure (no clinical or microbiological evidence of infection)
3. No ongoing use of antibiotics for the index joint; and
4. The prosthesis present after the initial management strategy is complete (destination prosthesis) still in place

hereafter referred to as 'treatment success'.

We assume the following DAG:

For each silo $l$ and site of infection $j$ we model the probability of treatment success as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[Y|L; \beta] &=  \text{expit}( \alpha_0 + \\ 
  &\quad \lambda_1 \mathbb{I}(L = 1) + \lambda_2 \mathbb{I}(L = 2) + \\
  &\quad \beta_1 \mathbb{I}(1-E_R) + ([\beta_2 R + \beta_3 R \mathbb{I}(S_{R_P} = 2) ])\mathbb{I}(E_R) + \\
  &\quad \beta_4 \mathbb{I}(1-E_D) + ([\beta_{5} R_P D + \beta_{6} R_P D \mathbb{I}(S_{R_P} = 2)])\mathbb{I}(E_D) + \\
  &\quad \beta_{7} \mathbb{I}(1-E_F) + \beta_{8} F E_F )
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mod-spec-1}

where 

+ $\alpha_0$ denotes the baseline log-odds of treatment success 
+ $\lambda_1$ denotes the shift associated with membership of the late silo
+ $\lambda_2$ denotes the shift associated with membership of the chronic silo
+ $\beta_{1}$ shift under non-reveal (surgery^[The parameter ignores potential differentiation for surgical type.])
+ $\beta_{2}$ shift under revision that was performed with one-stage procedure for long duration and no-rif
+ $\beta_{3}$ relative shift under revision that was performed with two-stage procedure for long duration and no-rif
+ $\beta_{4}$ shift under non-reveal (duration) with no differentiation for surgical nor duration preference
+ $\beta_{5}$ shift for short duration when one-stage was actually performed
+ $\beta_{6}$ shift for short duration when two-stage was actually performed
+ $\beta_{7}$ shift under non-reveal (choice) with no differentiation for choice preference
+ $\beta_{8}$ shift for rif

There are situations where the design matrix could be singular, which would necessitate removing redundant terms from the model.

In the full model, there would be additional terms to capture time trends, site variation and prognostic covariates.


### Early infection

Patients with early stage infection are not randomised into the surgical domain.
The surgical intervention will usually be dair and the 12 weeks antibiotic duration is recommended.
There are instances where early stage infection patients will receive a surgical intervention, in which case they will enter the duration domain for randomisation of long vs short dependent on the type of revision received.

### Late infection

Patients with late infection enter all domains, but with some restrictions.
They are randomised to dair vs revision in the surgical domain. 
Patients allocated to revision will receive a one or two-stage procedure, the plan for which should be captured at the time of randomisation.
The surgical intervention actually received should also be captured as this may deviate from the original plan.

The reference level parameters for the treatment effects are all set to zero.
Duration effects are currently completely pooled across silo, although this will likely be revised.

### Chronic infection

Patients with chronic stage infection are not randomised into the surgical domain.

## Priors

As with the linear predictor, the priors are currently targeted towards the simulation work but may be appropriate for the final model.

### Intercepts

The silo and infection site intercepts are given independent normal priors

\begin{aligned}
\alpha_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1.5^2)
\end{aligned}

On the probability scale, these concentrate on 0.5 with 95% of the density between 0.04 and 0.96, approximately uniform across this interval.

While the intercept priors are currently independent, consideration should be given to partial pooling across site of infection.

There are no randomisation options for early stage infection in domains A and B and therefore the baseline log-odds (intercept) refers to the cohort of patients that were not randomised within A nor B and randomised to the reference group for domain C.
In contrast, for the late stage patients, the baseline log-odds of treatment success is interpreted contextually for the cohort of patients that were randomised to the reference level of domains A, B and C, see below.

### Other covariates

Independent standard normal priors are assumed for all other covariate terms effects.


## Treatment effects

Assume that $\delta_{j,i} = \eta_j - \eta_i$ characterises a change in the log-odds of treatment success under intervention $j$ versus $i$ where the treatments are defined by some combination of parameters from the linear predictor and where the change may be silo-specific, pooled or some variation of these.
Pre-specified trial adaptations and/or trial announcements are made in relation to the posterior probabilities associated with these parameteres.
We consider non-inferiority, superiority, futility for non-inferiority and futility for superiority, defined as follows^[Irrespective of whether the treatments are used routinely, I think it is a mistake to completely dismiss the possibility of identifying a treatment as inferior.]:

### Non-inferiority

We define a non-inferiority margin of $\phi = \log{1/1.1} \approx -0.095$ to be used across all treatment effects and consider $j$ to be non-inferior to $i$ if $Pr(\delta_{j,i} > \phi) > 0.99$.

That is, the non-inferiority decision rule will deem a slightly worse treatment to be non-inferior.

### Superiority

We define superiority relative to a zero difference between treatments and consider $j$ to be superior to $i$ if $Pr(\delta_{j,i} > 0) > 0.99$.

### Futility

We define futility relative to a zero difference between treatments and consider $j$ to be superior to $i$ if $Pr(\delta_{j,i} > 0) < 0.05$.
